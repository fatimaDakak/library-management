# library-management
This project is in the form of a static website for managing a library using the C language. This application allows the administrator to manage books and borrowers by performing several operations such as adding, deleting, searching, listing, and more. To manipulate the data related to books and borrowers, we have defined two data structures:

1. Book type, which includes the following fields:
   - Book ID
   - Author's name
   - Title
   - Number of copies

2. Borrower type, which includes the following fields:
   - Borrower ID
   - Borrower's name
   - Number of borrowed books
